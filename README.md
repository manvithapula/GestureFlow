# Gesture Flow
Gesture Flow is an AR-powered sign language learning app designed to make learning fun, immersive, and accessible. It combines real-time gesture recognition, gamified challenges, and structured learning modules to help users master sign language effortlessly.

# Problem Statement
Learning sign language is often challenging due to the lack of interactive and engaging resources. Traditional methods are expensive, static, and fail to provide real-time feedback, making it difficult for learners to practice and improve their skills. Gesture Flow addresses this gap by leveraging AR and AI for an interactive learning experience.
